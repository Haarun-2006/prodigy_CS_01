# PRODIGY_CS_01
This program combines HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity to create a cohesive and user-friendly navigation experience. It demonstrates basic web development principles such as responsive design (fixed navigation bar), visual feedback (color changes on scroll and hover), and separation of concerns (HTML for structure, CSS for presentation, JavaScript for behavior). Adjustments can be made to enhance visual design, add functionality, or integrate with backend services as needed for specific web development projects.
